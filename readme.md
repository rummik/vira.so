 [Vira](vira.so)
=================
Vira will be an augmented reality game revolving around capturing and battling
virtual monsters ('Vira') with friends, other players in your area, and players
across the globe.


## The Algorithmâ„¢

Data sources:

- Map data
  - Open StreetMap is probably the best bet for this
- Population data
  - Some types of Vira like being around people more than others, and some
    types don't like being around people
  - From the US it looks like this is freely available from census.gov
- Weather data
  - All the things influence what kinds of Vira appear
  - Forecast.io has a nice (inexpensive) looking API for this

Current types of Vira:

- Water
- Wind / Air
- Ice
- Fire
